# Unit-4-Game

Object of the game: Figure out the value of each stone and try to reach the goal with out going over!

Used a pokemon theme but did not use any Pokemon unfortunately

I wanted to use this project to start trying to write cleaner code and really utilizing the psuedocoding 

Also thought assignment was due Saturday and did not have time to style it the way I wanted too
