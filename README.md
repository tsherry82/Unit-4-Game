# Unit-4-Game

Object of the game: Figure out the value of each stone and try to reach the goal with out going over!

Used a pokemon theme but did not use any Pokemon unfortunately

I wanted to use this project to start trying to write cleaner code and really utilizing the psuedocoding 

Also thought assignment was due Saturday and did not have time to style it the way I wanted too
=================================================

8/21
As i update my portfolio and reflect on my older assignments I want to go back and fix them, 

for this assignment all of my logic works but the styling is bland and does not stand out.

again I want to update the styling and the lay out of the page more so it is more engaging with the user.
I also used pokemon evolution stones so I could add a pokemon theme and add an Eevee that will evolve into one of its evolutions when you guess right and then faint or something if guessed wrong
